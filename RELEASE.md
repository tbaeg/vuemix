# RELEASE

## v2.0.0
* Modify `schema` property from `component` to `mixin`.
* Bind `store` and `methods` to functions defined in the `schema` as `{state, methods}` allowing access to state and methods from self.

## v1.1.1
* Remove `as` parameter requirement. This prevents binding to the data object and simply exposes the store to the component instance.

## v1.0.1
* Updates to project build/structure
* New minified build + source maps

## v1.0.0
* First release
